Date/time operations
====================

``TIME`` literals have the form ``TIME 'HH:MM:SS.FFF``, where the
fractional part is optional.

Values of type ``DATE``, ``TIME``, and ``TIMESTAMP`` can be compared
using ``=``, ``<>``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``<=>``,
``BETWEEN``; the result is a Boolean.

The following arithmetic operations are supported:

.. list-table:: Arithmetic on date/time values

  * - operation
    - result type
    - Explanation
  * - ``DATE`` + ``INTEGER``

The following are legal time units:

.. list-table:: Time units
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Time unit
    - Meaning
  * - ``MILLENNIUM``
    - A thousand years
  * - ``CENTURY``
    - A hundred years; a number between 1 and 10
  * - ``DECADE``
    - Ten years; a number between 1 and 10
  * - ``YEAR``
    - One year; can be positive or negative
  * - ``QUARTER``
    - 1/4 of a year; a number between 1 and 4
  * - ``MONTH``
    - One month; a number between 1 and 12
  * - ``WEEK``
    - Seven days.  The definition of "week" is quite involved: ''The year's
      first week is the week containing the first Thursday of the year or
      either the week containing the 4th of January or either the week that
      begins between 29th of Dec. and 4th of Jan.''  The week number is
      thus a value between 0 and 53.
  * - ``DOY``
    - Day of year, a number between 1 and 366
  * - ``DOW``
    - Day of week, with Sunday being 1 and Saturday being 7
  * - ``ISODOW``
    - ISO day of the week, with Monday 1 and Sunday 7
  * - ``DAY``
    - A day within a month, a number between 1 and 31
  * - ``HOUR``
    - An hour within a day, a number between 0 and 23
  * - ``MINUTE``
    - A minute within an hour, a number between 0 and 59
  * - ``SECOND``
    - A second within a minute, a number between 0 and 59
  * - ``MILLISECOND``
    - A millisecond within a *minute*, including the number of seconds
      multiplied by 1000, a number between 0 and 59,999
  * - ``MICROSECOND``
    - A microsecond within a *minute*, including the number of seconds
      multiplied by 1,000,000, a number between 0 and 59,999,999
  * - ``EPOCH``
    - Number of seconds from Unix epoch, i.e., 1970/01/01.

Operations on dates
-------------------

``DATE`` literals have the form ``DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD'``.

The following operations are available on dates:

``EXTRACT(<unit> FROM date)`` where ``<unit>`` is a time unit, as
described above.  Result is always a ``BIGINT`` value.

The following abbreviations can be used as well:

``YEAR(date)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date)``.

``MONTH(date)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)``.

``DAYOFMONTH(date)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(DAY FROM
date)``.

``DAYOFWEEK(date)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(DOW FROM
date)``.

``HOUR(date)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(HOUR FROM date)``.
For dates it always returns 0, since dates have no time component.

``MINUTE(date)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM date)``.
For dates it always returns 0, since dates have no time component.

``SECOND(date)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(SECOND FROM date)``.
For dates it always returns 0, since dates have no time component.

``FLOOR(datetime TO <unit>)``, where ``<unit>`` is a time unit.

``CEIL(datetime TO <unit>)``, where ``<unit>`` is a time unit.

Operations on timestamps
------------------------

A timestamp contains both a date and a time.  ``TIMESTAMP`` literals
have the form ``TIMESTAMP 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.FFF'``, where the
fractional part is optional.

Timestamp literals can only represent 4-digit year positive values.
Values BC or values greater than 10,000 years are not supported.

The precision of timestamps is milliseconds, additional digits of
precision in timestamp literals are rounded to milliseconds.

The following operations are available on timestamps:

``EXTRACT(<unit> FROM timestamp)`` where ``<unit>`` is a time unit, as
described above.  Result is always a ``BIGINT`` value.

The following abbreviations can be used as well:

``YEAR(timestamp)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp)``.

``MONTH(timestamp)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(MONTH FROM timestamp)``.

``DAYOFMONTH(timestamp)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(DAY FROM
timestamp)``.

``DAYOFWEEK(timestamp)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(DOW FROM
timestamp)``.

``HOUR(timestamp)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(HOUR FROM timestamp)``.

``MINUTE(timestamp)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM timestamp)``.

``SECOND(timestamp)`` is an abbreviation for ``EXTRACT(SECOND FROM
timestamp)``.

``TIMESTAMPDIFF(<unit>, left, right)`` computes the difference between
two timestamps and expresses the result in the specified time units.
The result is a 32-bit integer.

Important unsupported operations
--------------------------------

Since DBSP is a *deterministic* query engine, it cannot offer support
for any function that depends on the current time.  So the following
are *not* supported: ``LOCALTIME``, ``LOCALTIMESTAMP``,
``CURRENT_TIME``, ``CURRENT_DATE``, ``CURRENT_TIMESTAMP``.
