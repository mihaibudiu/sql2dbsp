Operations on arrays
====================

An array type can be created by applying the ``ARRAY`` suffix to
another type.  For example ``INT ARRAY`` is an array of integers.
Array indexes start from 1.  Array sizes are limited to 2^31 elements.
Array elements may be nullable types, e.g., ``INT ARRAY NULL``.
Multidimensional arrays are possible, e.g. ``VARCHAR ARRAY ARRAY``
is a two-dimensional array.

The UNNEST SQL Operator
-----------------------

The ``UNNEST`` operator takes an ``ARRAY`` and returns a table with a
row for each element in the ``ARRAY``: ``UNNEST(ARRAY) [WITH
ORDINALITY]``.  If the input is an array with 5 elements, the output
is a table with 5 rows, each row holding one element of the array.
The additional keyword ``WITH ORDINALITY`` creates an output table
with two columns, where the second column is the index of the element
within the array, with numbering starting at 1.  If the array contains
duplicated values, the resulting table will be a multiset.

The ``UNNEST`` operator can be used in self-joins as follows:

```
SELECT city, country
FROM data, UNNEST(cities) AS t (city)
```

where we assume that the ``data`` table has a schema defined
as ``CREATE TABLE data AS (CITIES VARCHAR ARRAY, COUNTRY VARCHAR)``.

Predefined functions on array values
------------------------------------

.. list-table:: Predefined functions on array values
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description
   * - ``ARRAY`` ``[`` value [, value]* ``]``
     - creates an array from a list of expressions that evaluate to
       values of the same type.
   * - ``array[index]``
     - where ``index`` is an expression that evaluates to an integer,
       and ``array`` is an expression that evaluates to an array.
       Returns the element at the specified position.  If the index
       is out of bounds, the result is ``NULL``.
   * - ``CARDINALITY(array)``
     - Returns the size of the array expression (number of elements).
   * - ``ELEMENT(array)``
     - Returns the single element of an array.  If the array
       has zero elements, returns ``NULL``.  If the array has more
       than one element, it causes a runtime exception.  (In the
       future we should probably replace the runtime exception with
       a ``NULL`` result for this case.)
